## Hi folks :wave:
As an Experienced Software Engineer, I specialize in building scalable web applications and occasionally work on system programming. I have extensive experience developing large-scale products using MERN stack and frameworks like NestJS and NextJS. Recently, I've expanded my knowledge of system programming, particularly through Rust & C, deepening my skills in low level programming and problem solving.

I am proficient in PostgreSQL, MongoDB and its ecosystem. It includs data modeling, DB design, query optimizations, query plan analysis and tools such as Graphile Worker, PostGIS, pg_trgm, pgvector. Additionally, I design and deploy cloud-based solutions using AWS services like EC2, ECS, RDS, Lambda, EventBridge, SQS & SNS, and API Gateway. I use Docker for containerization and I am highly skilled in developing CI/CD pipelines.

Over the years, I've refined my ability to translate complex business challenges into efficient software architectures. My versatility across different technology stacks enables me to adapt quickly to various requirements. Alongside my web development expertise, I have experience collaborating with both business and technical stakeholders in agile environments, which has further honed my ability to deliver impactful solutions.
