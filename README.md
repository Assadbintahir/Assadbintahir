## Hi folks :wave:

------

I am a **Software Engineer** who have experience of working on several large scale web products based on MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack & Golang. I also have moderate level expertise on AWS based technologies & cloud development. Over time, I have developed skills to translate business processes into software solutions. My ability to adapt to different stacks have made me comfortable with several technologies. I have exposure of working with both business and technical stakeholders in agile environments. TDD is what I believe [most of the times] is the way to write safe and robust code. Apart from JS ecosystem, golang and cloud computing is another area of my interest.
