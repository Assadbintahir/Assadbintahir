## Hi folks :wave:

------

Building scalable web products and delving into system programming - that's what excites me as a **Principal Software Engineer** at [10Pearls](https://10pearls.com/). I have experience of working on several large scale web products based on MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack & Golang. I also have moderate level expertise on several AWS services including EC2, ECS, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway etc. Over time, I have developed skills to translate business processes into software solutions. My ability to adapt to different stacks have made me comfortable with several technologies. I also have exposure of working with both business and technical stakeholders in agile environments. My recent interest for low level programming has led me to explore the Rust ecosystem.
