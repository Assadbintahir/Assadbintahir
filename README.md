## Hi folks :wave:

------

Building scalable web products and delving into system programming - that's what excites me as a **Principal Software Engineer** at [10Pearls](https://10pearls.com/). I have experience of working on several large scale web products based on MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack & Golang. I also have moderate level expertise on several AWS services including EC2, ECS, RDS, Lambda, API Gateway etc. Over time, I have developed skills to translate business processes into software solutions. My ability to adapt to different stacks have made me comfortable with several technologies. I also have exposure of working with both business and technical stakeholders in agile environments. Recently, my passion for system programming has led me to explore the Rust ecosystem, expanding my knowledge of low-level programming and further enhancing my problem-solving skills
